# Judge Bot

## What is Judge Bot?
Judge bot is my personal project, It is designed as a Discord bot that does all sorts of useful (and useless) things. You will often find me updating this bot and filling it with commands that may be relevant to games I enjoy.

Judge Bot utilizes the [nyxx][1] API library for Discord, making creating commands, and managing the bot much simpler. Huge shout out to [l7ssha][2] and other contributors for continued maintenance of this package, and their help in the [Official nyxx discord server][3] 
 
## How To Run
Coming soon

## Want to add Judge Bot to your server?

Contact Andy#1590 on Discord if you would like to use my hosted bot. You're welcome to clone it and run it yourself, of course.

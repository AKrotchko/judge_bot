I fuck water but wish water was fucking me instead. It\'s become a fuck of sorts, or maybe it\'s just water. I can\'t go anywhere without seeing fuck water. I went to feed my dog the other night, but instead of eating she fuck water. I had to put her down. I sit in the corner now counting down the days, the days where we shall see sweet release from this torment, the day when fucking was about you and your partner having a special bond and creating something beautiful. Those days are long gone. I have seen God, and I have seen the devil, but they are one and the same. I stared into the abyss and screamed, and it screamed back: "Fuck water".', event);

So between the 2 games you work on, cause you play them both, i know you play them both, try to keep up on, cause what kind of community manager would you be if you didn\'t play the games you manage right? I know you play them both, we talked about that before. So out of those 2 games, there\'s gotta be one, everyone has the one that got away, which character did you really want, between FFBE and WoTV, probably FFBE, what character did you want but you couldn\'t get? Cause people here know that there\'s a couple ones that got away from me. I got real lucky but there\'s a couple that got away from me. Especially recently. Especially Aphmau, who I\'m a FF11 fan, but just get the tickets alright. Geez, I just want my puppet master, as a puppet master main, as a puppet master character, I want the puppet master character from the puppet master game, but which one got away from you?', event);
